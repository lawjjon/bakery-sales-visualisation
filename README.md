# Bakery Sales Data Visualisation Project

## Project Overview

This project provides an interactive data visualisation of a Bakery Sales dataset using Tableau. The dataset is pre-processed with Pandas in the `bakery_sales_data_introduction.ipynb` notebook, and the visualisation is hosted on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/BakerySales-MovingAverageWithTimePeriodSelection/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Dataset

The Bakery Sales dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hosubjeong/bakery-sales?select=Bakery+Sales.csv). It contains just under 10 months of detailed sales data, allowing for in-depth visualisation.

## Features

- **Moving Average Visualisation:** Displays a moving average of total sales. Users can adjust the moving average period.
- **Time Period Selection:** Users can click and drag to select a specific time period. The total sales, list of items sold, and hourly sales breakdown update according to the selection.
- **Items Sold List:** Shows the number of each item sold during the selected time period.
- **Hourly Sales Breakdown:** Visualises sales data broken down into each hour for the selected time period.
